{"status":"complete","result":{"text":" The governor's surgery, a constitution on patient, the adora Paul. Data birth is February 21, 1981. Data injury June 4, 2024. Today's day is December 18, 2024. Chief complaint is neck pain, pain and bell shoulders and lower back pain. Had the up to you to see Ms. Theodora Paul in the neurosurgery office. For a constitution visit, she's a 43 year old right handed woman who presents with complaints of... Server cows are reading. It's the shoulders by a lot of really in lower back pain following a motor vehicle collision on June 4, 2024. She recalls that she was in her usual state of health and was the driver of a vehicle that was cut off by a crossing vehicle resulting in a collision and extensive damage. The EMS came to the scene, but Ms. Paul was not taken to the hospital. She notes that her pain flared up by the following day and that she has been dealing with pain ever since. She's received physical therapy, which she states has helped to some degree, but did not give rid of Paul of her pain. Currently, she describes both Server cows and lower back pain at a three or four on the scale of zero through ten in terms of intensity. Amulation has not been significantly curtailed despite her symptoms. It's Paul Deniz, a recent biolorec, bladder heavy change, current medications. Include Tylenol and Advolcius non-agrobiology, family history is non-contribatory, post-surgical exam is Paul's 5-fetanage, just always 104 pounds. She's a well-developed, well-nourished young, timid-lage, black female, and no acute distress. Hard is regular rate and rhythm lungs are a quibbloscutation. Relogically, she's a wakeler oriented, times three with low and speech and following simple questions. People's Rical Round Reactive to light face moves symmetrically. Modern exam, upper extremity strains are four plus of the five throughout lower extremity strains are full through a deep ten reflexes or two plus and symmetric and there is no clonus. Gate is an unremarkable, straight-ling raised test is negative by a loud, really spine exam is mildly limited in flexion and sensual binding of a rotation of a circle on non-barx fine MR of the circle spine form. June 26, 2021 was reviewed. This study demonstrates multiple disc protrusions measuring one to two millimeters throughout the circle spine at the C5-6 level. There is a two millimeter disc protrusion with a central annular tear. There's lots of the usual cervical-loader of the curvature. MR of lower spine form June 26, 2000, point full is also reviewed. This study demonstrates one millimeter disc protrusions at L34 and L45 without significant stenosis. There's lots of the usual long-barb-loader of the curvature. And light of his pulse symptoms, further neurological exam in her radiographed findings is my impression that she is suffering from. Serve at Calzure reading, shoulders by laterally and lower back pain following a motor vehicle collision on June 4, 2024. Her spinal symptoms are likely due to disc discogenic pain as well as sensualization excitation of nerves to the facet and posterior musculatriazers' ultradromas sustained at the time of the collision barrier treatment options were discussed and she has expressed an understanding of the issue at hand. His pulse states that she would prefer less invasive treatments, which I feel is appropriate. I've advised her that she is a candidate for a advisor that she may be a candidate for treatment such as a series of two or three cervical-loader epidural storage injections, depending on her clinical course. She has expressed an understanding of the issue at hand. If you should have any further questions, data.","segments":[{"id":0,"seek":0,"start":0.24,"end":6.06,"text":" The governor's surgery, a constitution on patient, the adora
