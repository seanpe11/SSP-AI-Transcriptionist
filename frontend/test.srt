1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Cloud edge is a hype.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
We do true edge.

3
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
We inject the software in the customer's windows distribution

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Yo, what's up with the camera?

5
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Dude, did you put Zoom on the microwave?

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This was the microwave?

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I finally found the CEO's email.

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We can send the demo tomorrow.

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I mean, I also have a social security number if you need it.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yo, our network's down.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Perfect.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I was stress testing it.

13
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh, did you see the new marketplace I rolled out?

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What?

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The demo we sent out to investors doesn't work.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I know, they're using Arc browser.

17
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
We don't need those investors.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I just came back from the meetup

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
on how to reduce our infra bill.

20
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Yeah, infra bill is $0 somewhere.

21
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Did you move our entire AWS stack to our Mac mini again?

22
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You know how I'll be.

23
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
We had a working CUDA driver for Linux the whole time?

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Hey man, have you heard GraphDBs?

25
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What if you use graph?

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Yeah.

27
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Okay.

28
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yo, did you see this new AR library on Twitter?

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Doesn't fit our use case.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It was out since today.

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
When have you tried it?

32
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It's my library.

33
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Is this Emacs and Temple OS?

34
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Oh, this is Spacemacs.

35
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Oh, what's this?

36
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Don't touch this.

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's part of our infra.

38
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You lost all our money on this CUDA cat?

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, it's back up.

40
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We're rich.

41
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh, I did rewrite the whole thing to Rust.

42
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Oh.

43
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I like the performance wasn't better,

44
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so I wrote it back.

45
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Or why don't we use it?

46
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I already destroyed all the code and burned the computer.

47
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
What?

48
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Yo, I wonder if I could write this in DeadFish.

49
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
No.

50
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Fixed the coffee machine?

51
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Patch the kernel?

52
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yo, not everything needs a kernel patch.

53
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I just turn it on and off.

54
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What is this?

55
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Custom Linux.

56
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Yo, our network's down.

57
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, no, no, it's a different one.

58
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I ran the script I found online

59
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
and now the prod DB is missing.

60
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, don't worry.

61
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,000
We have a backup.

62
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
The whole backup.

63
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Everything is gone.

64
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wait, I have a backup you didn't know about.

65
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Can't trust humans.

66
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
This is our backup.

67
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What about making it readable?

68
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Who else needs to read this?

69
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh, on the production website,

70
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I added like a Homer button.

71
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If you press it, you can see the customer statistics

72
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
all in one go.

73
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It renders in 12.4 milliseconds.

74
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
People can see our customer statistics publicly?

75
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yeah, but it's super performant.

76
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
People can see our customer statistics publicly?

77
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Man, it still isn't working on 360 videos.

78
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We don't support 360 video.

79
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We do in a few minutes.

80
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How long do you think this is gonna take?

81
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Three to five hours.

82
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
If you leave the room, maybe two.

83
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Oh, is that your diploma?

84
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What?

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Oh, yeah, man, I need that for my visa.

86
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yo, I wrote the library from scratch.

87
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What?

88
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yo, I wrote our own crypto.

89
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What?

90
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Just to be safe.

91
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We missed the deadline.

92
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I sent it out 20 minutes ago already.

93
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Did you want me to send the iOS or the Android version?

94
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What?

95
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The iOS version.

96
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, cool, I sent both.

97
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What is this?

98
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Oh, it's just I'm debugging in ASCII.

99
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm not gonna waste resources.

100
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We're two JavaScript frameworks away

101
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
from actually launching this.

102
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What?

103
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm joking, I'm joking.

104
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's all lost and hopeless.

105
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What?

106
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We need the feature today for the demo.

107
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hold on, my OS just broke.

108
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Let me just fix it first.

109
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, actually, you know what?

110
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I think it's just a Vulkan bug.

111
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We don't need the UI.

112
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We need the UI.

113
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What?

114
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Okay, okay, let's-

115
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Isn't our demo on the PC?

116
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Yeah, rip.

117
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm horrible at coding.

118
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yo, what do you think about this UI design?

119
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Oh, that's perfect.

120
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
How long to put in the app?

121
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is the app.

122
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You're good at front end, too.

123
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We need to raise money.

124
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I put all our money in Bitcoin, we're good.

125
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Cool, what else?

126
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Dude, Metaverse is dead.

127
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I already see with the guy who built it.

128
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm trying to hire more engineers.

129
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Just let me know which ones you want.

130
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No, hire less engineers.

131
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Less engineers.

132
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hire marketing people.

133
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
We need marketing people.

134
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We already have 12.

135
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hire accounting.

136
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We need accounting people.

137
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What about product management?

138
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Nah, all right.

139
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Okay, it's PlayStation VM.

140
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Written in Haskell.

141
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
No, SSL is a joke.

142
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I know the guy who built the backdoor.

143
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What backdoor?

144
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
What?

145
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No, Solana is a joke.

146
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I know the guy who's going to dump it.

147
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What?

148
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh yeah, forget that.

149
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You're good at this, too.

150
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, so when he kept saying crody,

151
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
that was actually like a Canadian reference.

152
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh, actually what Kendrick Lamar meant

153
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
when he was talking.

154
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Come on, man.

155
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
We need the demo in one hour.

156
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:18,000
It will be done by then, don't worry.

157
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I got it, I got it.

158
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I will be ready.

159
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Oh, my OS just broke.

160
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Just let me fix that first.

161
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Come on, man.

162
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yeah, I'll be done by then.

163
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Is this 2K25?

164
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah.

165
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Limited edition?

166
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Hijacked edition.

167
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What does that say?

168
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, that's just compiler small talk.

169
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's red.

170
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Compilers always be complaining.

171
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Dude, new LLVM version and stuff.

172
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Build is failing, though.

173
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
We have a demo coming up.

174
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Ah, don't worry, I'll fix-
